# TicTacToe Game in React

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either 'X' or 'O'. The game includes win detection, a reset button, and is styled with CSS for a clean and modern look.

## Features

- Two-player functionality
- Win detection and display of the winner
- Reset button to restart the game
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Hover effects for interactive gameplay

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- CSS: Styling the game board and elements
